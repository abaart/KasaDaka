# KasaDaka
The KasaDaka "Talking box" is a platform designed to rapidly develop multi-lingual data-centric services to be run on anything from a RaspberryPi to a Data Centre

The software on Kasadaka is as much as possible Free and Open Source software to allow for community-development and to make it as affordable as possible. The Kasadaka project builds on information acquired from workshops in Burkina Faso, Mali, Ghana and Niger, focusing on the development of ICT services that support regreening activities in rural, often remote areas in the Sahel.
